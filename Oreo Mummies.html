    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces white confectioners' coating, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>16 chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®)</li>
        <li>32 mini candy eyeballs</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol> 
        <li>Melt candy melts in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes.
            <div>Scoop a heaping tablespoon into a resealable plastic bag and set aside.</div></li>
        <li>Working 1 at a time, use a butter knife to spread the candy melt over the top and around the sides of each cookie. 
            <div>Place on wax paper.</div></li>
        <li>Seal the resealable plastic bag and snip off 1 of the corners with scissors. 
            <div>Pipe stripes over the top of the cookies in a back-and-forth pattern. It's okay if the stripes are uneven or at different angles.</div></li>
        <li>Before the stripes dry, stick two candy eyeballs on the top of each cookie.</li>
        <li>Allow the candy coating to dry and harden before serving (you can expedite the hardening process by placing the wax paper and cookies into the refrigerator for a few minutes).</li>       
    </ol>
